Meetings Every Thursday @ 8PM at CVMake

We are forming a new makerspace in Westlake Village to serve the Conejo Valley area. The Conejo
Valley Makerspace will support and embrace the resurgence of hands‐on Do‐It‐Yourself and maker
culture through classes, meetups, membership, and community outreach where engineers, artists,
students, and entrepreneurs can make ideas into real things.
