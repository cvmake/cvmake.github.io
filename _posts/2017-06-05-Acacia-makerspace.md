The [Acacia](http://www.conejousd.org/acacia/) Elementary School for Enriched Learning invited our makers to their makerspace.
We had a fun time learning and making together.
The students took apart some TV remote controls to see how they worked and made some fun jewelry.

This event was a special award for the top 11 maker students who won a variety of #STEAM achievements this year.
