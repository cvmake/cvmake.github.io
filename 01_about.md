Community / Membership / Workspace
Meetings Every Thursday 7:00 - 9:00 PM
We are a makerspace created to serve the Conejo Valley area. The Conejo Valley Makerspace will support and embrace the resurgence of hands‐on Do‐It‐Yourself and maker culture through classes, meetups, membership, and community outreach where engineers, artists, students, and entrepreneurs can make ideas into real things.

About the physical space: Workbenches, Electronics Equipment, 3D Printers, Woodworking, Aluminum CNC Mill, and more!
