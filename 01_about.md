**The Conejo Valley MakerSpace is where new and experienced Makers of all ages connect to work on real projects, share, learn, and have fun.**

We are a makerspace created to serve the Conejo Valley area. The Conejo Valley Makerspace will support and embrace the resurgence of hands‐on Do‐It‐Yourself and maker culture through classes, meetups, membership, and community outreach where engineers, artists, students, and entrepreneurs can make ideas into real things.

We meet every Thursday and host other scheduled events and classes.
